This LaTeX Package makes it possible make commands that call specific blocks of code by putting a character in front of the command (i.e. "\somecommand!"). This was originally intended for easy access to documentation, but any LaTeX functionality is supported. The aim of this package is to seamlessly integrate this idea for use by package authors.
